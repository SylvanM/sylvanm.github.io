# Overview
I am an undergraduate studying Mathematics and Computer Science at Cornell University. Though I am still
exploring my interests in these fields, I've always taken a liking to cryptography and machine learning, and right now I've been studying
post-quantum lattice-based cryptographic schemes. Outside of schoolwork, I am a rock climbing and caving instructor
for Cornell Outdoor Education, and a backpacking trip guide for incoming freshmen students to Cornell.

I've always found that the best way I learn things is when I force myself to explain them to others, which 
is what is going on in the [cryptography](cryptography/crypto.md) section. They are just explainers to myself, 
but if anyone else finds them helpful, awesome!

## Projects
Here are some of the things I've worked on either in the past, or am working on currently! Click on the name of any project to be taken to the GitHub site. If you want a brief discussion of the project rather than just reading the whole GitHub, go to the 
[projects page!](projects/projects.md)

 - [ml_kit](https://github.com/SylvanM/ml_kit): A work-in-progress machine learning library for Rust, in collaboration with Owen Wetherbee and Ethan Ma
 - [rusty_crypto](https://github.com/SylvanM/rusty_crypto): A post-quantum cryptographic suite written in Rust
 - [algebra_kit](https://github.com/SylvanM/algebra_kit): An abstract algebra library for Rust
 - [matrix_kit](https://github.com/SylvanM/matrix_kit): An abstract *linear* algebra library for Rust (sensing a pattern here?)
 - [Ocaml ECC](https://github.com/SylvanM/cs3110-sectool): Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Helman in OCaml
 - [BigNumber](https://github.com/SylvanM/BigNumber): A performance based big-integer library for Swift

There are many more but these are just some of my favorites.

## Tutorials and Writeups

As I'm working on new projects, there are certain problems I run into that I realize I will need to re-solve in later projects,
or that other people will run into as well. For a lot of these problems, there exists a good online tutorial already written. But,
for some niche topics, I could not find a (in my opinion) well-written tutorial online that actually answered the questions I had.
So, I'm writing tutorials and explainers for others and mainly for myself!

*This is a work in progress and tutorials are coming soon, but these are the tutorials I intend to make soon!*

### Machine Learning

My group for the [ml_kit](https://github.com/SylvanM/ml_kit) project had a meeting where we worked out the math for 
backpropagation together. The notes of which can be found [here](https://github.com/SylvanM/ml_kit/blob/writeup/writeups/tex/notes.pdf)
under March 5th.

### Cryptography

See the [cryptography page](cryptography/crypto.md) for an explanation of the Learning With Errors cryptosystem.

### Miscellaneous

- Calling (Asynchronous!) Rust Code from C and Swift
	- This one is [hard](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/w2tlzv/comment/igs8797/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and I'm still working on a tutorial. 
- Implementing Big Number Division

## [Rock Climbing](climbing/CLIMBING.md)
And [here](climbing/CLIMBING.md) is where you can see cool rock climbing stuff
